# Privacy Policy

This repo is used to deploy services for DiagramGPT, an experiment GPT in OpenAI's new GPT marketplace. We prioritize your privacy and data security. Our commitment to safeguarding your information is reflected in our straightforward privacy practices:

- Data Collection: We make a best effort try not to collect, store, or process any data for business purposes. This is an experiment, not a business. Data may occasionally appear in our service logs as part of debugging, but is not retained, sold, or distributed to anyone. 
- Data Retention: Any data accidentally collected or collected as part of debugging efforts will be deleted as soon as practical.
- Referral to Third-Party Services: While our service does not collect or store your data, we may provide data-containing links to third-party services such as mermaid.ink. Please be aware that these third-party services have their own privacy policies, which may differ from ours.  We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services or OpenAI.

By using our service, you acknowledge and agree to these terms. We are committed to maintaining a safe and private environment for all our users.
